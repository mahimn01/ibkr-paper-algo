Regime Transition Alpha Strategy

Exploits Hidden Markov Model regime TRANSITIONS rather than regime states.

Key Insight:
    Most managers react to regime changes AFTER they happen. HMM transition
    probabilities can PREDICT them. This strategy extracts alpha from the
    predictive information embedded in the transition matrix dynamics.

Alpha Sources:
    1. Transition probability level: P(current_regime -> target_regime)
    2. Transition velocity: d/dt of transition probabilities
    3. Multi-regime scoring: probability-weighted expected returns across
       all destination regimes
    4. Regime uncertainty premium: higher uncertainty -> higher transition
       likelihood -> stronger signal

Position Sizing:
    - Kelly-inspired: f = edge / variance
    - Inverse volatility scaling
    - Regime-conditional confidence adjustments

Exit Rules:
    - Regime fully established (>70% probability in new regime)
    - Time-based: max 20 day holding period
    - ATR-based stop loss

class RegimeTransitionStrategy:
    """
    Alpha strategy exploiting HMM regime transition dynamics.

    Rather than reacting to the current regime (which is backward-looking
    and already priced in by most participants), this strategy monitors
    the HMM transition probability matrix over time and trades on:

    1. Rising transition probabilities toward bearish regimes (short).
    2. Rising transition probabilities toward bullish regimes (long).
    3. The velocity of transition probability changes (momentum of the
       regime shift itself).
    4. Multi-regime expected return scoring to handle ambiguous transitions.

    The core insight is that transition probabilities contain FORWARD-LOOKING
    information about regime changes before they are confirmed by price
    action, giving a timing edge over managers who wait for regime
    confirmation.

        hmm = HiddenMarkovRegime(n_states=3)
